Move seamlessly between **writing** and **referencing**. Protect your finished notes from accidental edits while keeping your active drafts ready to write.

## Features

- **Smart Lock Logic**:
    - **Strong Lock (Reading)**: Permanently locks files for review or presentation.
    - **Safe Edit (Editing)**: Allows editing but respects explicit locks on archived files.
- **Folder Rules**: Automatically lock files in specific folders (e.g., `Archives/`, `References/`). Supports Longest Prefix Match.
- **Frontmatter Rules**: Lock individual files using metadata (e.g., `status: done`, `type: archive`).
- **Time-based Auto Lock**: Automatically lock old notes based on creation or modification date. (e.g., "Lock creation after 30 days").
- **Visual Cues**:
    - **Status Bar**: See current global mode at a glance (Auto, Locked, Editing).
    - **Tab Icon**: A lock icon appears on the tab header whenever you are in **Reading Mode**.
- **Hotkeys & Commands**: Cycle modes or toggle locks instantly via Command Palette.

## How It Works

Dynamic Lock determines the view mode based on a **Priority System**:

1.  **Global Force Reading**: Overrides EVERYTHING. Useful for presentations.
2.  **Frontmatter Rules**: Explicit file-level control (`status: done` -> Reading).
3.  **Folder Rules**: Section-level control (`Archives/` -> Reading).
4.  **Time-based Lock**: (If enabled) Locks old files automatically.
5.  **Global Force Editing**: Forces Editing mode.
6.  **Auto Mode**:
    - **Strict Rules**: Locks files matching the rules above.
    - **Free Navigation**: New files default to **Editing Mode** unless locked.
    - **Tab Persistence**: Switching tabs preserves your manual mode (Reading/Editing) for open files.

## Usage

### 1. Global Modes (Click Status Bar)
| Icon | Mode | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Auto | **Auto** | The **Smart Mode**. Locks matched files, keeps others editable, and remembers your tab state. |
| Locked | **Reading** | **Presentation Mode**. Forces ALL files to Reading view. |
| Editing | **Editing** | **Work Mode**. Forces Editing view (resets manual reading checks). |

> **Tip**: You can assign a hotkey to `Dynamic Lock: Cycle global mode` for quick switching!

### 2. Time-based Locking
Forget about manually locking files.
- Go to **Settings > Time-based Lock**.
- Enable it and set a period (e.g., **30 Days**).
- Choose **Creation Date** (good for Daily Notes/Diaries) or **Modified Date** (good for Wikis).

### 3. Visual Feedback
Locked status is clear and intuitive:
- **Lock Icon**: Appears on the tab header whenever the file is in **Reading Mode** (whether enforced by rule or set manually).
- **No Icon**: The file is in **Editing Mode**.
